# About Syslogine

**Syslogine** is a comprehensive technology platform dedicated to providing professional system administration tutorials, documentation, and open-source development resources. Founded in 2024, we serve developers, system administrators, and IT professionals worldwide with practical, hands-on technical content.

## Our Story

What began as documenting our team's hands-on experience in system administration and infrastructure management has evolved into a robust knowledge platform. Originally built with Hugo, we've transitioned to Docusaurus to provide an enhanced documentation experience with improved navigation, advanced search capabilities, and a modern, accessible interface.

Our journey reflects our commitment to continuous improvement—both in the technologies we cover and how we deliver that knowledge to our community.
